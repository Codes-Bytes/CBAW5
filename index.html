                    <p>
                      Hello! I'm Kruthi SriSai, a proud product of the esteemed CBIT college in Gandipet, Hyderabad, Telangana, India. My passion for technology led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology, where I immersed myself in the world of coding and innovation. During my academic journey, I honed my skills in various areas, including nan, nan, nan, nan, and nan. My interest in these fields extended beyond theoretical knowledge, as I actively participated in projects and workshops to gain practical experience.

Apart from academics, I am an avid dancer, drawer, and painter. I find immense joy in expressing myself through these art forms. When I'm not coding or creating art, you'll find me exploring the latest music and indulging in my favorite pastime of binge-watching TV shows and movies.

My journey at CBIT has not only equipped me with technical expertise but has also instilled in me a strong work ethic and a commitment to excellence. I am eager to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology. Let's connect and explore the possibilities together.
